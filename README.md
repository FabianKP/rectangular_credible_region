Simultaneous credible intervals for unimodal probability distributions
===

This Python module contains an approximate method to estimate 
*simultaneous credible intervals* (sometimes also called
simultaneous credible *bands*) given samples from a unimodal, multivariate
probability distribution, including distributions that are truncated by convex
constraints.

Given a unimodal probability density function $p(x)$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and
samples $x^{(1)}, \ldots, x^{(N)}$, the method computes a small, $d$-dimensional
box that contains a given percentage (e. g. 95% or 99%) of the samples.

For a more detailed explanation, see [this notebook]().
